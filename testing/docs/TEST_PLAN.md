# ReskFlow Comprehensive Test Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the ReskFlow enterprise blockchain reskflow platform, covering all aspects of quality assurance including functional, performance, security, and reliability testing.

## 1. Test Objectives
- Ensure all microservices function correctly in isolation and as an integrated system
- Validate API contracts between services
- Verify system performance under expected and peak loads
- Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities
- Ensure system resilience and fault tolerance
- Validate business logic and user workflows

## 2. Testing Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
- All 26 microservices and their APIs
- Integration points between services
- Event-driven messaging systems
- Database operations and data integrity
- Authentication and authorization
- Payment processing workflows
- Real-time tracking functionality
- Admin and reporting features

### 2.2 Out of Scope
- Frontend/UI testing (separate test plan)
- Third-party service internals (only integration points)
- Infrastructure provisioning

## 3. Testing Categories and Approach

### 3.1 Unit Testing (60% of tests)
**Objective**: Test individual components in isolation
**Tools**: Jest (TypeScript/JavaScript)
**Coverage Target**: 80% minimum

### 3.2 Integration Testing (20% of tests)
**Objective**: Test service interactions and database operations
**Tools**: TestContainers, Docker Compose
**Approach**: Test each service with its dependencies

### 3.3 Contract Testing (10% of tests)
**Objective**: Ensure API compatibility between services
**Tools**: Pact
**Approach**: Consumer-driven contracts

### 3.4 End-to-End Testing (5% of tests)
**Objective**: Validate critical user journeys
**Tools**: Postman/Newman, custom scripts
**Scenarios**: Order placement, reskflow tracking, payment processing

### 3.5 Performance Testing (Continuous)
**Objective**: Ensure system meets performance SLAs
**Tools**: K6, Grafana
**Metrics**: Response time, throughput, resource utilization

### 3.6 Security Testing (Continuous)
**Objective**: Identify and fix vulnerabilities
**Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Snyk
**Focus**: API security, container security, dependency scanning

### 3.7 Chaos Engineering (Weekly)
**Objective**: Test system resilience
**Tools**: Chaos Monkey, custom scripts
**Scenarios**: Service failures, network issues, database outages

## 4. Test Environment Strategy

### 4.1 Environments
1. **Local Development**: Docker Compose setup for developers
2. **CI/CD Testing**: Automated tests on each commit
3. **Integration**: Full microservices deployment
4. **Performance**: Production-like environment for load testing
5. **Security**: Isolated environment for security scans

### 4.2 Test Data Management
- Use TestContainers for isolated databases
- Seed data scripts for consistent test scenarios
- Anonymized production data for performance testing
- Dynamic data generation for load tests

## 5. Test Execution Strategy

### 5.1 Continuous Integration
- Unit tests on every commit
- Integration tests on pull requests
- Contract tests before deployment
- Security scans on dependency updates

### 5.2 Scheduled Testing
- Daily: Full integration test suite
- Weekly: Performance tests, chaos experiments
- Monthly: Full security audit
- Quarterly: Disaster recovery tests

### 5.3 Manual Testing
- Exploratory testing for new features
