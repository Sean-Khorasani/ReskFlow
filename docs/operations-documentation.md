## Executive Summary

This Operations Documentation provides comprehensive procedures for maintaining the ReskFlow's availability, performance, and security. It covers backup strategies, disaster recovery procedures, business continuity planning, and day-to-day operational management.

### Key Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 15 minutes for critical services
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 5 minutes for transactional data
- **Availability Target**: 99.99% uptime (52.56 minutes downtime/year)
- **Data Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 nines)

### Critical Success Factors

1. Automated backup and recovery procedures
2. Multi-region disaster recovery capability
3. Regular testing and validation
4. Clear communication protocols
5. Trained operations team

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy Overview

```yaml
backup_strategy:
  approach: 3-2-1 Rule
  implementation:
    - 3 copies of data (production + 2 backups)
    - 2 different storage media types
    - 1 offsite backup location
  
  types:
    full_backup:
      frequency: weekly
      retention: 4 weeks
      storage: S3 Glacier
    
    incremental_backup:
      frequency: daily
      retention: 7 days
      storage: S3 Standard-IA
    
    continuous_backup:
      frequency: real-time
      retention: 24 hours
      method: database replication
```

### Database Backup Procedures

#### PostgreSQL Backup

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# PostgreSQL Backup Script
# /opt/ReskFlow/scripts/backup-postgres.sh

# Configuration
DB_NAME="reskflow"
DB_USER="postgres"
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/postgres"
S3_BUCKET="s3://ReskFlow-backups/postgres"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/postgres_${DATE}.sql.gz"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Perform backup with compression
echo "Starting PostgreSQL backup at $(date)"
pg_dump -h localhost -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -v -Fc -Z9 > $BACKUP_FILE

# Verify backup
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup successful: $BACKUP_FILE"
    
    # Upload to S3
    aws s3 cp $BACKUP_FILE $S3_BUCKET/daily/ \
        --storage-class STANDARD_IA \
        --server-side-encryption AES256
    
    # Create restore point
    echo "CREATE_RESTORE_POINT:$DATE" >> $BACKUP_DIR/restore_points.log
else
    echo "Backup failed!"
    # Send alert
    /opt/ReskFlow/scripts/send-alert.sh "PostgreSQL backup failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Cleanup old backups (keep 7 days local)
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "postgres_*.sql.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
```

#### MongoDB Backup

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# MongoDB Backup Script
# /opt/ReskFlow/scripts/backup-mongodb.sh

# Configuration
MONGO_URI="mongodb://reskflow:password@localhost:27017/reskflow"
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/mongodb"
S3_BUCKET="s3://ReskFlow-backups/mongodb"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Perform backup
echo "Starting MongoDB backup at $(date)"
mongodump --uri="$MONGO_URI" \
    --gzip \
    --archive="$BACKUP_DIR/mongodb_${DATE}.gz" \
    --readPreference=secondary

# Upload to S3 with lifecycle policy
aws s3 cp "$BACKUP_DIR/mongodb_${DATE}.gz" \
    $S3_BUCKET/daily/ \
    --storage-class STANDARD_IA
```

#### Redis Backup

```yaml
# Redis Backup Configuration
# /etc/redis/redis.conf

# Enable persistence
save 900 1      # Save after 900 sec if at least 1 key changed
save 300 10     # Save after 300 sec if at least 10 keys changed
save 60 10000   # Save after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed

# Append-only file
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec

# Backup script
backup_redis:
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    REDIS_CLI="redis-cli -a $REDIS_PASSWORD"
    BACKUP_DIR="/backup/redis"
    
    # Trigger background save
    $REDIS_CLI BGSAVE
    
    # Wait for completion
    while [ $($REDIS_CLI LASTSAVE) -eq $last_save ]; do
      sleep 1
    done
    
    # Copy RDB file
    cp /var/lib/redis/dump.rdb $BACKUP_DIR/redis_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).rdb
```

### Application Data Backup

```yaml
# Application Data Backup Strategy
application_data:
  user_uploads:
    source: /data/uploads
    destination: s3://ReskFlow-data/uploads
    method: aws s3 sync
    frequency: hourly
    retention: 90 days
  
  logs:

// /opt/ReskFlow/scripts/backup-blockchain.js

const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

async function backupBlockchainState() {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
  
  // Get current block
  const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
  
  // Backup smart contract states
  const contracts = [
    { name: 'DeliveryRegistry', address: '0x...' },
    { name: 'PaymentEscrow', address: '0x...' },
    { name: 'AccessControl', address: '0x...' }
  ];
  
  for (const contract of contracts) {
    const code = await provider.getCode(contract.address);
    const storage = await getContractStorage(contract.address);
    
    const backup = {
      contractName: contract.name,
      address: contract.address,
      blockNumber,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      code,
      storage
    };
    
    // Upload to S3
    await s3.putObject({
      Bucket: 'ReskFlow-blockchain',
      Key: `backups/${contract.name}_${blockNumber}.json`,
      Body: JSON.stringify(backup),
      ServerSideEncryption: 'AES256'
    }).promise();
  }
}
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Database Recovery

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# PostgreSQL Recovery Script
# /opt/ReskFlow/scripts/recover-postgres.sh

# Parameters
RESTORE_POINT=$1
BACKUP_FILE=$2

# Stop application services
echo "Stopping application services..."
systemctl stop ReskFlow-*

# Restore database
echo "Restoring PostgreSQL from $BACKUP_FILE"
pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d reskflow_restore -v $BACKUP_FILE

# Verify restore
psql -U postgres -d reskflow_restore -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"

# Switch databases
psql -U postgres <<EOF
ALTER DATABASE reskflow RENAME TO reskflow_old;
ALTER DATABASE reskflow_restore RENAME TO reskflow;
EOF

# Start services
systemctl start ReskFlow-*

echo "Recovery completed at $(date)"
```

#### Point-in-Time Recovery

```sql
-- PostgreSQL Point-in-Time Recovery
-- Restore to specific timestamp

-- 1. Stop the database
pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/postgresql/data

-- 2. Restore base backup
tar -xzf /backup/postgres/base_backup.tar.gz -C /var/lib/postgresql/data

-- 3. Configure recovery
cat > /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf <<EOF
restore_command = 'cp /archive/%f %p'
recovery_target_time = '2025-07-10 14:30:00'

## Incident Management

### Incident Classification

```yaml
incident_levels:
  P1_Critical:
    definition: Complete service outage or data breach
    response_time: 5 minutes
    escalation: Immediate
    examples:
      - Platform completely unavailable
      - Payment system failure
      - Customer data exposure
  
  P2_Major:
    definition: Significant degradation affecting many users
    response_time: 15 minutes
    escalation: 30 minutes
    examples:
      - Regional outage
      - Core feature unavailable
      - Performance degradation >50%
  
  P3_Minor:
    definition: Limited impact on subset of users
    response_time: 1 hour
    escalation: 4 hours
    examples:
      - Single feature issue
      - Slow performance <50%
      - Non-critical service failure
  
  P4_Low:
    definition: Minimal impact, workaround available
    response_time: 4 hours
    escalation: Next business day
    examples:
      - UI glitches
      - Documentation errors
      - Non-urgent bugs
```

### Post-Mortem Process

```markdown
## Post-Mortem Template

### Incident Summary
- **Incident ID**: INC-2025-001
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Severity**: P1
- **Services Affected**: Payment processing
- **Customer Impact**: 5,000 failed transactions

### Timeline
- 14:00 - Spike in payment failures detected
- 14:05 - On-call engineer alerted
- 14:10 - Issue confirmed, crisis team activated
- 14:20 - Root cause identified (expired certificate)
- 14:35 - Certificate renewed, services restarting
- 14:45 - Full service restored

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Direct Cause**: SSL certificate expiration
- **Contributing Factors**:
  - Certificate monitoring alert failed
  - Manual renewal process
  - No automated validation

### Lessons Learned
1. Certificate management needs automation
2. Monitoring alerts require redundancy
3. Runbook was outdated

### Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Implement cert auto-renewal | DevOps | 2025-07-20 | In Progress |
| Add redundant monitoring | SRE | 2025-07-15 | Planned |
| Update runbooks | On-call | 2025-07-12 | Completed |

### Prevention Measures
1. Automated certificate management
2. Monthly cert expiration audits
3. Improved monitoring coverage
```
